## Puppet

* Version >= 4.10.0

## REFERENCES

Please see [REFERENCE](REFERENCE.md) for more details.

## Example with hiera

```yaml
---
classes:
  - openvpn

openvpn::servers:
  'winterthur':
    country: 'CH'
    province: 'ZH'
    city: 'Winterthur'
    organization: 'example.org'
    email: 'root@example.org'
    server: '10.200.200.0 255.255.255.0'

openvpn::client_defaults:
  server: 'winterthur'

openvpn::clients:
  'client1': {}
  'client2': {}
  'client3': {}

openvpn::client_specific_configs:
  'client1':
    server: 'winterthur'
    ifconfig: '10.200.200.50 10.200.200.51'

openvpn::revokes:
  'client3':
    server: 'winterthur'
```

Don't forget the sysctl directive ```net.ipv4.ip_forward```!

## Encryption Choices

This module provides certain default parameters for the openvpn encryption settings.

These settings have been applied in line with current "best practices" but no
guarantee is given for their saftey and they could change in future.

You should double check these settings yourself to make sure they are suitable for your needs and in line with current best practices.

## Example for automating client deployment to nodes managed by Puppet

Exporting the configurations for a client in the VPN server manifest:
```
  openvpn::deploy::export { 'client1':
    server => 'winterthur',
  }
```
Installation, configuration and starting the OpenVPN client in a configured node manifest:
```
  openvpn::deploy::client { 'client1':
    server => 'winterthur',
  }
```

such choices.

* The OpenVPN documentation about the [SWEET32](https://community.openvpn.net/openvpn/wiki/SWEET32) attack gives some reasons and
recommendations for which ciphers to use.

* The OpenVPN [hardening documentation](https://community.openvpn.net/openvpn/wiki/Hardening) also gives further examples

### ssl_key_size

The default key size is now set to `2048` bits.
This setting also affects the size of the dhparam file.

##### Why

> 2048 bits is OK, but both [NSA](https://cryptome.org/2016/01/CNSA-Suite-and-Quantum-Computing-FAQ.pdf) and [ANSSI](https://www.ssi.gouv.fr/uploads/2015/01/RGS_v-2-0_B1.pdf) recommend at least a 3072 bits for a future-proof key. As the size of the key will have an impact on speed, I leave the choice to use 2048, 3072 or 4096 bits RSA key. 4096 bits is what's most used and recommened today, but 3072 bits is still good.


### Cipher

The default data channel cipher is now set to `AES-256-CBC`

##### Why

OpenVPN was setting its default value to `BF-CBC`. In newer versions of OpenVPN
it warns that this is no longer a secure cipher.
The OpenVPN documentation recommends using this setting.

### tls_cipher

The default tls_cipher option is now set to: `TLS-DHE-RSA-WITH-AES-256-GCM-SHA384:TLS-DHE-RSA-WITH-AES-256-CBC-SHA256:TLS-DHE-RSA-WITH-AES-128-GCM-SHA256:TLS-DHE-RSA-WITH-AES-128-CBC-SHA256`

##### Why

Details of these ciphers and their uses can be found in the documentation links above.

Note : TLS ciphers suites shipped with OSes ubuntu14.04 and debian8 are too old compared to our default values.
If the openvpn server is running on these OSes with clients on more modern OSes, you will probably have to use custom value for option `tls_cipher`.
